OGXRepacker is a general-purpose, simplistic XISO processing software for Original Xbox games. It specializes in converting game images to XISO images while also offering the option to create an attacher.

If youâ€™re unsure what this means, simply leave the settings at their defaults, select an input and output folder, and press "Process" to get started.

# Quickstart

## Windows
Windows-specific executables are available. Windows on ARM is **not** supported. Both 64-bit and 32-bit architectures are fully supported.

- ### The easiest way to get started is to download the latest [OGX Windows installer](https://github.com/astarivi/OGXRepacker/releases/latest/download/OGXRepacker_x64_Setup.exe). This includes everything you will need to run OGX.
- The [bundled Windows portable](https://github.com/astarivi/OGXRepacker/releases/latest/download/ogx-windows-bundled.zip) distribution contains everything the installable distribution does, in a portable package.
- The [minimal Windows portable](https://github.com/astarivi/OGXRepacker/releases/latest/download/ogx-windows-minimal.zip) distribution only has the essentials, and requires Java >17 to be installed in your system.

## Linux
Linux has its own distributable package, which includes a wrapper script for launch.

```bash
# Download the latest `ogx-VERSION.zip` release.
# Remember to replace VERSION with the latest release version.
wget https://github.com/astarivi/OGXRepacker/releases/latest/download/ogx-VERSION.zip

# Extract it
unzip ogx-VERSION.zip
cd ogx-VERSION/bin

# Make the script executable
chmod +x ogx
# Run the script
./ogx
```

## Universal
This release works on both Windows and Linux. Use this if you experience problems with your platform-specific release.

- Download the latest `ogx-VERSION-all.jar` release.
- Run with `java -jar ogx-VERSION-all.jar`
- If Java version 17 or higher is associated with .jar files, double-clicking works too.

# Features

- Maximum compatibility with input images
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Able to split output images on the fly
- Able to rebuild, trim, keep, or extract the input image
- Includes all known attachers, from Cerbios to DriveImageUtils
- Leverages Repackinator content database

# Configuration

Every feature available in OGXRepacker is listed here.

- ## Naming Convention
    - ### OGXRepacker
        - Uses the OGXRepacker filename system, consisting of the Repackinator title and a single-letter region code.
        - Example: `Halo 2 (G)`
    - ### Repackinator
        - Uses the Repackinator naming convention, with three-letter region codes.
        - Example: `Halo 2 (GLO)`
    - ### Keep filename
        - Keeps the input filename and uses it for the output.
        - Example: `HALO 2`

- ## Pack Mode
    - ### XISO Auto
        - Automatically chooses the best `XISO` packing mode for the detected input files.
        - Will always try to produce the smallest output image possible.
        - Defaults to `XISO Rebuild` if **Naming Convention** is set to `Keep filename`.
    - ### XISO Rebuild
        - Rebuilds the input image or packs an input folder.
        - Often produces smaller images with no performance penalties.
        - A few games are known to fail to boot when this mode is used. Use `XISO Auto`, which checks for these cases.
    - ### XISO Trim
        - Trims the empty sectors at the end of the image, leading to modest file size savings.
        - Redump images are the only known input that benefit from this mode.
        - Defaults to `XISO Rebuild` if the input is detected to be a folder.
    - ### XISO
        - Keeps the input image intact and passes it through.
        - If a Redump image is used, this mode will strip unnecessary data from the image but will keep the XISO partition untouched.
        - Defaults to `XISO Rebuild` if the input is detected to be a folder.
    - ### Extract only
        - Extracts the contents of an input image.
        - Only `.iso` images are supported.
        - If input is a folder, it will be skipped.
        - Incompatible with Attachers and Split modes.

- ## Create Attacher
    - ### Cerbios
        - Creates a Cerbios attacher.
        - Supports CCI images.
        - Does not support CSO images.
        - Best overall compatibility.
    - ### Stellar
        - Creates a Project Stellar attacher.
        - Supports CSO images.
        - Does not support CCI images.
    - ### DriveImageUtils (Legacy)
        - Creates a DriveImageUtils attacher, compatible with old softmods.
        - Does not support CCI images.
        - Does not support CSO images.
        - Most consoles support newer attachers; use only if needed.
    - ### None
        - Skips the attacher and produces only output images.

Note: All attachers support regular XISO images.

- ## Split Image
    - ### Split at FATX limit
        - Splits the output image only when it's close to the FATX size limit.
    - ### Split in half
        - Splits the output image into two parts of approximately the same size.
        - If the input file is too small, only a single file will be produced.
    - ### Do not split
        - Produces a single `.iso` output image.
